     * notice that we do not need to take into account where the small books are, 
     * as long as the large and medium are sorted correctly, 
     * it guarantees position of the small books will be correct too.
     * we can tell what should be the correct arrangement is 
     * just by calculating the frequency of each character
     * so we know what books should be in which position, therefore we can split the shelf 
     * into the "large", "middle" and "small" sections
     * a normal swap means a book will be moved to an incorrect section to a correct one.
     * but if a medium book is in the large section, and a large book is in a 
     * medium section, we can swap the two to essentially get double value out of 
     * the swap.
