# CCC-Solutions

A collection of solutions for the Canadian Computing Contest throughout the years. I hope that my solutions are acutally well commented, readable and understandable. You can do with the solutions as you want.

My CCC scores:
- 68/75 2022 CCC Junior - Just hit the honour roll cutoff but I wasn't included because I didn't use a school account lol
- 62/75 2023 CCC Junior - Threw because I didn't practice and was extremely sick on that day
- 32/75 2024 CCC Senior - Got stuck on problem 3, didn't practice

Reasons I decided to upload my solutions
- I was sick of solutions that were unreadable
- To keep a record for myself
